pv6 is a portable re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6). Pv6 is based on xv6, which was originally written for x86
multiprocessors in ANSI C. It is currently ported to x86 and RISCV, but it
should be easy to port to other architectures as well.

See https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2014/xv6.html for more on xv6 and the file
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.XV6 for the acknowledgments for the original xv6 project.

BUILDING AND RUNNING PV6

Until development is more stable I'm leaving build instructions out of this
document, since they change too frequently.
