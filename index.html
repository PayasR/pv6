        <h1>The Design of pv6</h1>

        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>pv6 is a fork of the teaching operating system <a
href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2014/xv6.html">xv6</a>, which is a
Unix-like OS based on Sixth Edition UNIX. The operating system runs on
multiprocessor x86 machines. Pv6 is being developed through the Google Summer of
Code program with the support of the <a
href="http://www.lowrisc.org/">lowRISC</a> organization. Pv6 started as an
attempt to port xv6 to the <a href="http://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a> architecture
in general and the lowRISC platform in particular, however, at the suggestion of
Alex Bradbury, my GSoC mentor for the project, we decided that it would be
useful and only slightly more work to restructure the source code of xv6 to make
it easy to port to other architectures as well. That said, my work this summer
will only focus on porting to RISC-V.<p>

        <p>This webpage collects the documentation I write explaining the design
and rationale of the RISC-V port. I hope that it is helpful for those curious
about operating system implementation or who want to port pv6 to other
architectures. As the summer progresses and I write up more of the development
process I will continue to update the list below.</p>
